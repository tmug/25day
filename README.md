Try something new for 25 days
=============================

This directory keeps track of my 25 day projects. The idea of 25 day
projects is inspired by:

* Matt Cutt's idea to [try something new for 30 days] [TED1]
* Josh Kaufman's talk on [the first 20 hours -- how to learn anything]
[TED2]
* Susam's [25 day challenges] [25d]
