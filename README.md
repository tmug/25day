Try something new for 25 days
=============================

This directory keeps track of my 25 day projects. The idea of 25 day
projects is inspired by:

* Matt Cutt's idea to [try something new for 30 days][TED1]
* Josh Kaufman's talk on [the first 20 hours -- how to learn anything][TED2]
* Susam's [25 day challenges][25d]

[TED1]: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnfBXjWm7hc>
[TED2]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY>
[25d]: <https://github.com/susam/25d>

The following is a list of my 25 day projects.

* [2015-06: Learn JavaScript from MDN JavaScript Guide][001]
* [2015-09: Core Java Volume I, 8th ed.][002]
